# Hi, there :cat2:

I work at [MPI-IS](https://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/) on simulation software, and software for realtime control of robots. And, configurations and shortcuts to make my work more enjoyable and colourful. And, I try to come up with better visualization techniques to look into what my code is up to.

I love to express myself through intricate prose and poorly drawn stick-figures, usually curious about too many things.
